	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>The challenge about this class is to use codes and following the steps each of them and it's a bit confusing if I floolowing the steps. I
		have a condition and I need help to work on the assignment and I'm glad I had a partner, but when I'm working by myself, I feel nervous
		and stress about this coding whenever I have trouble to work on.</p>
