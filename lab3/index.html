	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The challenge about using HTML is to use codes and following the steps each of them and it's a bit confusing if I following the steps. I
			got use to creating HTML, but I was wondering if I get stuck on or what if I didn't do exactly what .</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The problems about this is that whenever I post an image, I always get problems and I don't know how to fix this. I always need a
			help to find the solution. Also I'm not too sure that if I made the codes correctly or not.</p>


		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results of HTML was that I got help from my partner and I did really well on it. Now I know how to work on HTML.</p>
